# Qwency (MVP)

One tap a day. Monthly = direction, weekly = awareness, daily = reality, reasons = truth.

Stack: Next.js 16 (App Router) · Clerk (auth) · Supabase (Postgres) · Tailwind v4.

## Setup

1. `npm install`
2. Clerk: create an app, put its keys in `.env`.
3. Supabase: create a project, put `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and
   `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` in `.env`.
4. Connect the two (one-time):
   - Clerk Dashboard -> Integrations -> Supabase -> activate, copy the Clerk domain.
   - Supabase Dashboard -> Authentication -> Sign In / Providers -> Third-Party Auth -> Add Clerk -> paste the domain.
5. Supabase **SQL Editor**: run `supabase/schema.sql`.
6. `npm run dev` -> http://localhost:3000

Supabase is called from the server with the publishable key plus the user's Clerk token;
RLS policies restrict every row to its owner.
